Dual-core 1GHz CPU, 256MB memory, 4 gigabit network interfaces, independent power amplifier, large memory, network interface support blind insertion, good appearance, high cost performance. The advantage over ax3000 is that the 5G band supports 4 * 4 mimo, allowing more devices to communicate at the same time.</td>
